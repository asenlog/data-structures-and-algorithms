# Data Structures and Algorithms in GO lang

## Description
Studying Data Structures and Algorithms can be hard, thus the creation of this 
repo. While I was studying them and trying to understand how they are implemented in Golang
I started building this repo. In each directory you will find the implementations 
of each Data Structure with usage examples, problems from LeetCode, HackerRank etc.

In each operation of each Data Structure the spacetime complexity has been calculated and show above
the method as a comment.
